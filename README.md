### Project Overview
This project will provide valuable insights into the composition and direction of India's export trade in 2019. The findings can be used by policymakers, businesses, and researchers to make informed decisions regarding trade strategies and future export opportunities.

### Data Sources
The primary dataset for data analysis is derived from "data.gov.in" which is Indian government's official site for populating country's significant data. 

### Tools
- Microsoft SQL server management studio (Data cleaning and exploration)
- Power bi (Data visualisation)

### Dataset description
The data includes four key columns
- Continent: Continent to which the goods were exported (e.g Asia, Africa, Europe)
- Country: Specific country receiving the exports
- Commodity: Type of good exported (e.g Gems, Textiles, Rice)
- Value: Monetary value of the exported goods

## METHODOLOGY

### Data cleaning and exploration
- Check for missing values and inconsistencies in the data.
- Analyze data types and descriptive statistics for each column.

### Data visualisation(Bar graph, pie charts, KPI, map)
- Top exported commodities and their respective values.
- Breakdown of export value by continent.
- Top importing countries with corresponding monetary values.
- Map giving visualisation of density in different continents.

### Results/Findings
- A clear understanding of India's most exported commodities in 2019.
- Insights into the geographical distribution of India's exports.
- Identification of any potential trends or patterns in the export data.
- A clear picture of top importers giving maximum revenue.

## Recommendations

This research can be furthur extended by adjoining it with more dataset relevant to the former
1. Investigate reasons behind significant export values or trends.
2. Consider external factors like global trade conditions or commodity prices.
3. Collecting data about non-importing countries and filtering potential buyers.
4. Lookout for products and commodities in demands.

## Limitations

### Insufficiency of data
1. A valuable column containing number of commodities was omitted from data as a larger percentage of data was unfilled affecting the actual trends or in few cases providing giving false derivations.
2. This research is a valuable and has more  potential if furthur extended with legit and relevant dataset.
